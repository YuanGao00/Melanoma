We selected male patient PET-CT scan images and collected their subcutaneous fat (sub-q fat) area and sub-q fat thickness using slices at the L3-L4 vertebral level. All the measurement are done by using ImageJ.
Sub-q fat: For each patient's slice, the subcutaneous fat area was measured 3 times and then we took the mean value for later analysis. As for subcutaneous fat thickness, we measured the thickness 3 times for both left and right body sides and then we took the mean value for the analysis.
Tumor size: We also collected the pre-treatment and post-treatment tumor sizes for each patient. We selected the axial CT slice with the largest axial area of tumor to represent the tumor size.
